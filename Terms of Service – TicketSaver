Last updated: September 15, 2025

These Terms of Service (‚ÄúTerms‚Äù) govern your use of the TicketSaver mobile application (‚ÄúApp‚Äù).
By using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the App.

1. Service Description

TicketSaver is a personal tool that allows users to:
	‚Ä¢	Store event tickets and related files locally on their device.
	‚Ä¢	Forward confirmation emails and attachments (via Mailgun) to be processed and displayed in the App.
	‚Ä¢	Manage events with limitations depending on subscription status (free tier vs. Premium).

TicketSaver is not an event organizer, ticket issuer, or reseller. We only provide a digital storage and management tool.

‚∏ª

2. No Guarantee of Ticket Validity
	‚Ä¢	TicketSaver does not guarantee that any ticket stored in the App will be accepted by an event organizer.
	‚Ä¢	Event organizers and venues remain solely responsible for ticket verification and admission.
	‚Ä¢	TicketSaver is not liable if a ticket is rejected, invalid, duplicated, expired, or otherwise not honored by an organizer.

‚∏ª

3. No Liability for Loss of Tickets or Accounts
	‚Ä¢	Tickets are primarily stored locally on your device. You are responsible for backing up your tickets (e.g., in your Files app or cloud storage).
	‚Ä¢	If you delete the App, delete your account, or lose access to your device, your tickets may be permanently lost.
	‚Ä¢	TicketSaver is not responsible for the loss, corruption, or deletion of tickets, attachments, or account data.

‚∏ª

4. Premium & Subscriptions
	‚Ä¢	Premium features (e.g., unlimited events) require an active paid subscription.
	‚Ä¢	When a subscription ends (including after a free trial), you will only have access to the first 5 events you created. Other events remain stored but inaccessible until you re-activate Premium.
	‚Ä¢	Subscriptions are managed via the Apple App Store. TicketSaver has no control over billing, renewals, or refunds. Refunds must be requested directly from Apple.

5. Anti-Abuse Controls

To prevent fraud and abuse:
	‚Ä¢	We validate purchase receipts server-side.
	‚Ä¢	We bind accounts to devices (single active device at a time).
	‚Ä¢	We may retain device identifiers or transaction IDs even after account deletion for fraud-prevention purposes.

	‚Ä¢	Use the App for unlawful purposes.
	‚Ä¢	Share, resell, or mass-import tickets in violation of an event organizer‚Äôs terms.
