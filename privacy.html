    <h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>

    <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>

    <h3>Personal Data</h3>
    <p>While using Our Service, we may ask you to provide certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Authentication details (when using email/password, Apple, or Facebook login)</li>
      <li>Purchase receipts (for premium validation)</li>
      <li>Consent metadata (e.g., version/date of accepted Terms &amp; Privacy Policy, app version at acceptance, device identifier used for consent sync)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Usage Data</h3>
    <p>Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service. It may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP address, Device identifiers, operating system, app version, language, and region</li>
      <li>Diagnostic information and crash logs (via Firebase Crashlytics)</li>
      <li>Interactions within the app (e.g., screens opened, certain actions) when analytics is enabled with your consent</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Advertising IDs:</em> TicketSaver does not use IDFA/AdTracking. We do not use Google Signals or Advertising Features.</p>

    <h3>Information from Third-Party Login Services</h3>
    <p>If you log in via Apple or Facebook, we may receive your name, email address, and identifiers associated with those accounts, as permitted by you.</p>

    <h3>Information from Device Access</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Camera and photo library (to import tickets)</li>

    </ul>
    <p>You can enable or disable access via your Device settings at any time.</p>
  </section>

  <hr>

  <section>
    <h2>SDKs and Providers We Use</h2>

    <h3>Firebase Analytics (Google)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We use Firebase Analytics to understand how the app is used and to improve functionality.</li>
      <li>When enabled, it collects event data (e.g., successful login/sign-up, ticket categorized, premium purchase), app instance identifiers, device/OS info, and approximate location (country/region) derived from IP.</li>
      <li>We disable analytics until you give consent. You can withdraw consent at any time in the app settings (where available) or by contacting us.</li>
      <li>We do not enable Google Advertising Features or Google Signals in TicketSaver.</li>
      <li><strong>Retention:</strong> according to Google’s standard retention settings (typically 2 months by default and configurable up to 14 months, subject to Google’s policies).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We use Firebase Crashlytics to monitor app stability and fix crashes.</li>
      <li>Crash reports may include device model, OS version, app version, timestamp, and non-sensitive logs around the crash.</li>
      <li>No advertising identifiers, and no content of your tickets.</li>
      <li><strong>Retention:</strong> typically around 90 days (subject to Google’s policies).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mailgun (Email processing)</h3>
    <p>If you forward confirmation emails/attachments, Mailgun processes and delivers these emails for ingestion by TicketSaver. Attachments may be temporarily processed to extract relevant ticket data.</p>

    <h3>Apple App Store (In-App Purchases)</h3>
    <p>Apple processes Subscription billing, renewals, refunds, and related financial information through your Apple ID. We may receive non-financial purchase metadata (e.g., transaction identifiers or signed receipts) to validate entitlements; we do not receive your full payment details from Apple.</p>

    <p>For all providers above, processing takes place under the providers’ terms and data processing agreements. International transfers may occur and are protected by appropriate safeguards (see <a href="#international-transfers">International Transfers</a>).</p>
  </section>

  <hr>

  <section>
    <h2>How We Use Your Personal Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the Service – including account creation, authentication, and storage of your tickets.</li>
      <li>To enforce account restrictions – e.g., free accounts may store up to 5 events; premium accounts may store unlimited events.</li>
      <li>To validate purchases – using server-side receipt validation to detect fraud or abuse of free trials.</li>
      <li>To manage device sessions – including device/session binding to prevent account sharing. Device IDs may be retained even after account deletion to prevent repeated abuse.</li>
      <li>To send transactional emails – via Mailgun, for example, to forward ticket confirmation emails.</li>
      <li>To provide push notifications and reminders – only if you enable notifications on your Device.</li>
      <li>To collect feedback – via Google Forms, if you voluntarily provide input.</li>
      <li>To monitor app stability and crashes – via Firebase Crashlytics.</li>
      <li>To analyze usage – via Firebase Analytics, only with your consent to improve the app and user experience.</li>
      <li>To secure the Service – including detection, prevention, and response to security incidents and abuse.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations – e.g., preventing fraud, abuse, or misuse of services, and responding to lawful requests.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR/AVG)</h2>
    <p>Where applicable law (e.g., EU/EEA, UK) requires a legal basis:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contract/Performance:</strong> providing the core Service you request (account, ticket storage).</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> analytics and optional features that are not strictly necessary (we collect analytics only after you consent).</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> security, anti-fraud (e.g., device/session binding, receipt validation), and app stability (Crashlytics) in a way that respects your rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> where we must comply with the law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may withdraw consent at any time (see Your Choices &amp; Controls).</p>
  </section>

  <hr>

  <section>
    <h2>Your Choices &amp; Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytics Consent:</strong> In-app analytics is off by default until you accept. You may later disable analytics in the app settings (where provided) or by contacting us; we will then stop sending future analytics events from that device/account.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Permissions:</strong> You can manage camera/photos/files access in iOS Settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can enable/disable push notifications in iOS Settings at any time. Disabling will stop future notifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Email Preferences:</strong> Transactional emails are necessary for the Service; we do not send marketing emails.</li>
      <li><strong>Access/Deletion Requests:</strong> See Your Rights below.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <hr>

  <section>
    <h2>Consent Management</h2>
    <p>Before you can use the Service, you must explicitly accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Your consent is stored locally on your Device and synchronized to your Account upon login. During synchronization, we record:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the version of the Terms/Privacy you accepted,</li>
      <li>the original date/time of first acceptance (from your Device),</li>
      <li>the most recent confirmation date/time (at login),</li>
      <li>app version and a device identifier used for consent sync.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using multiple Accounts on the same Device applies the same consent to each Account.</p>
  </section>

  <hr>

  <section>
    <h2>Sharing Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>We may share your personal data in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With Service Providers – such as Firebase (authentication, database, crash reporting, analytics, cloud functions), Mailgun (email forwarding), and Google Forms (feedback collection).</li>
      <li>For fraud prevention and security – e.g., device/session binding, receipt validation.</li>
      <li>For legal reasons – to comply with applicable law or protect rights, property, or safety.</li>
      <li>Business transfers – in connection with any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business, subject to appropriate safeguards.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your data to third parties.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>International Transfers</h2>

    <h2>Automated Decision-Making</h2>

  </section>

  <hr>

  <section>

  <section>
    <h2>Account Deletion and Apple Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Deleting your Account within the App removes your personal data from our active systems, subject to the retention rules set out above. <strong>Deleting your Account does not cancel your Apple Subscription.</strong> Subscriptions are managed through your Apple ID, and only you can cancel or modify them in your Apple settings (App Store → Account → Subscriptions).
