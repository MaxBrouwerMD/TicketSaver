Last updated: September 15, 2025

These Terms of Service (‚ÄúTerms‚Äù) govern your use of the TicketSaver mobile application (‚ÄúApp‚Äù) and related services. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the App.

1. Service Description

TicketSaver is a personal tool that allows users to:
	‚Ä¢	Store event tickets and related files locally on their device.
	‚Ä¢	Forward confirmation emails and attachments (via Mailgun) to be processed and displayed in the App.
	‚Ä¢	Manage events with limitations depending on subscription status (Free tier vs. Premium).

TicketSaver is not an event organizer, ticket issuer, or reseller. We only provide a digital storage and management tool.

‚∏ª

2. No Guarantee of Ticket Validity
	‚Ä¢	TicketSaver does not verify, validate, or guarantee that any ticket stored in the App will be accepted by an event organizer, venue, or third party.
	‚Ä¢	Event organizers and venues remain solely responsible for ticket verification, admission, and enforcement of their own terms.
	‚Ä¢	TicketSaver is not liable if a ticket is rejected, invalid, duplicated, expired, misused, or otherwise not honored.

‚∏ª

3. No Liability for Loss of Tickets or Accounts
	‚Ä¢	Tickets are primarily stored locally on your device. You are solely responsible for backing up your tickets (e.g., in the Files app or cloud storage).
	‚Ä¢	If you delete the App, delete your account, or lose access to your device, your tickets may be permanently lost.
	‚Ä¢	TicketSaver is not responsible for:
	‚Ä¢	loss, corruption, or deletion of tickets,
	‚Ä¢	failed or incomplete imports,
	‚Ä¢	errors caused by device failure, app crashes, or user error.

‚∏ª

4. Premium & Subscriptions
	‚Ä¢	Premium features (e.g., unlimited events) require an active paid subscription.
	‚Ä¢	Subscriptions are managed through the Apple App Store. TicketSaver has no control over billing, renewals, or refunds. Refund requests must be directed to Apple.
	‚Ä¢	Free trials are offered once per user and may be restricted to prevent abuse.
	‚Ä¢	When a subscription ends (including after a free trial):
	‚Ä¢	You will retain access only to the first 5 events you created.
	‚Ä¢	Other events remain stored but inaccessible until Premium is reactivated.

‚∏ª

5. Anti-Abuse & Fraud Prevention

To protect the Service:
	‚Ä¢	We validate purchases using server-side receipt validation.
	‚Ä¢	We enforce device/session binding: only one active device may use your account at a time.
	‚Ä¢	We may retain device identifiers or transaction records even after account deletion to detect and prevent:
	‚Ä¢	repeated free-trial abuse,
	‚Ä¢	account sharing,
	‚Ä¢	fraudulent purchases.

‚∏ª

6. Acceptable Use

You agree not to use the App to:
	‚Ä¢	Violate applicable laws or third-party rights.
	‚Ä¢	Import, store, or share tickets unlawfully (e.g., forged, duplicated, or resold tickets).
	‚Ä¢	Circumvent or attempt to circumvent our fraud-prevention systems.
	‚Ä¢	Upload malicious code, spam, or other harmful content.

Violation of these rules may result in suspension or termination of your account.

7. Third-Party Services

The App relies on third-party services, including but not limited to:
	‚Ä¢	Firebase (authentication, database, crash reporting, cloud functions),
	‚Ä¢	Mailgun (email forwarding and delivery),
	‚Ä¢	Apple App Store (subscriptions, billing),
	‚Ä¢	Social logins (Apple, Facebook).

TicketSaver is not responsible for downtime, errors, or data handling practices of these third parties. Their use is governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

9. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:
	‚Ä¢	TicketSaver shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, revenue, profits, or event access.
	‚Ä¢	TicketSaver‚Äôs total liability for direct damages shall not exceed the greater of:
