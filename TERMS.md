Terms of Service
==============

Last updated: September 20, 2025

These Terms of Service (‚ÄúTerms‚Äù) govern your use of the TicketSaver mobile application (‚ÄúApp‚Äù) and related services. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the App.

‚∏ª

Service Description

TicketSaver is a personal tool that allows users to:
	‚Ä¢	Store event tickets and related files locally on their device.
	‚Ä¢	Forward confirmation emails and attachments (via Mailgun) to be processed and displayed in the App.
	‚Ä¢	Manage events with limitations depending on subscription status (Free tier vs. Premium).

TicketSaver is not an event organizer, ticket issuer, or reseller. We only provide a digital storage and management tool.

‚∏ª

No Guarantee of Ticket Validity
	‚Ä¢	TicketSaver does not verify, validate, or guarantee that any ticket stored in the App will be accepted by an event organizer, venue, or third party.
	‚Ä¢	Event organizers and venues remain solely responsible for ticket verification, admission, and enforcement of their own terms.
	‚Ä¢	TicketSaver is not liable if a ticket is rejected, invalid, duplicated, expired, misused, or otherwise not honored.

‚∏ª

No Liability for Loss of Tickets or Accounts
	‚Ä¢	Tickets are primarily stored locally on your device. You are solely responsible for backing up your tickets (e.g., in the Files app or cloud storage).
	‚Ä¢	If you delete the App, delete your account, or lose access to your device, your tickets may be permanently lost.
	‚Ä¢	TicketSaver is not responsible for:
	‚Ä¢	loss, corruption, or deletion of tickets,
	‚Ä¢	failed or incomplete imports,
	‚Ä¢	errors caused by device failure, app crashes, or user error.

‚∏ª

Premium & Subscriptions
	‚Ä¢	Premium features (e.g., unlimited events) require an active paid subscription.
	‚Ä¢	Subscriptions are managed through the Apple App Store. TicketSaver has no control over billing, renewals, or refunds. Refund requests must be directed to Apple.
	‚Ä¢	Free trials are offered once per user and may be restricted to prevent abuse.
	‚Ä¢	When a subscription ends (including after a free trial):
	‚Ä¢	You will retain access only to the first 5 events you created.
	‚Ä¢	Other events remain stored but inaccessible until Premium is reactivated.

‚∏ª

Anti-Abuse & Fraud Prevention

To protect the Service:
	‚Ä¢	We validate purchases using server-side receipt validation.
	‚Ä¢	We enforce device/session binding: only one active device may use your account at a time.
	‚Ä¢	We may retain device identifiers or transaction records even after account deletion to detect and prevent:
	‚Ä¢	repeated free-trial abuse,
	‚Ä¢	account sharing,
	‚Ä¢	fraudulent purchases.

‚∏ª

Acceptable Use

You agree not to use the App to:
	‚Ä¢	Violate applicable laws or third-party rights.
	‚Ä¢	Import, store, or share tickets unlawfully (e.g., forged, duplicated, or resold tickets).
	‚Ä¢	Circumvent or attempt to circumvent our fraud-prevention systems.
	‚Ä¢	Upload malicious code, spam, or other harmful content.

Violation of these rules may result in suspension or termination of your account.

‚∏ª

Third-Party Services

The App relies on third-party services, including but not limited to:
	‚Ä¢	Firebase (authentication, database, crash reporting, analytics, cloud functions),
	‚Ä¢	Mailgun (email forwarding and delivery),
	‚Ä¢	Apple App Store (subscriptions, billing),
	‚Ä¢	Social logins (Apple, Facebook).

TicketSaver is not responsible for the downtime, errors, or data handling practices of these third parties. Their use is governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

‚∏ª

Disclaimer of Warranties

The App is provided on an ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù and ‚ÄúAS AVAILABLE‚Äù basis. TicketSaver makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to:
	‚Ä¢	That the App will function uninterrupted, error-free, or without security issues.
	‚Ä¢	That tickets stored in the App will be valid, recognized, or accepted by third parties.
	‚Ä¢	That data stored locally or in Firebase will never be lost, corrupted, or deleted.

‚∏ª

Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:
	‚Ä¢	Exclusion of damages. TicketSaver shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, revenue, profits, goodwill, or event access, arising out of or in connection with the use of the App.
	‚Ä¢	Free users. If you use the Service without a paid subscription, you agree that TicketSaver shall have no liability whatsoever for any claim, damage, or loss of any kind.
	‚Ä¢	Premium users. If you have a paid subscription, TicketSaver‚Äôs total aggregate liability for direct damages shall not exceed the amount you actually paid for Premium during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
	‚Ä¢	Scope. These limitations apply to all claims, whether based on contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, even if TicketSaver has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	‚Ä¢	Mandatory law carve-out. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law, such as liability for fraud, intentional misconduct, or gross negligence.

You acknowledge and agree that use of the App is entirely at your own risk, and that these limitations are an essential basis of the bargain between you and TicketSaver.

‚∏ª

Termination

We may suspend or terminate your account or access to the App if you:
	‚Ä¢	Violate these Terms,
	‚Ä¢	Misuse the App,
	‚Ä¢	Engage in fraud, abuse, or unlawful conduct.

You may also terminate your account at any time by deleting it within the App.

‚∏ª

Acceptance of Terms and Privacy Policy

Use of the App is only permitted if you have accepted both the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy.
Your acceptance is stored locally on your Device.
When you create or sign in to an Account, your existing acceptance is automatically synchronized and recorded in our systems for that Account. The synchronization updates the account record with the version of the Terms and Privacy Policy you accepted, the original acceptance date, and the most recent confirmation at login.
By signing in with multiple accounts on the same Device, you confirm that each account is bound by your acceptance of the Terms and Privacy Policy.

‚∏ª

Governing Law & Jurisdiction
	‚Ä¢	These Terms are governed by the laws of the Netherlands.
	‚Ä¢	Any dispute shall be submitted exclusively to the competent courts of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
