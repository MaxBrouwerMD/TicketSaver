Terms of Service
==============

Last updated: October 26, 2025

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the TicketSaver mobile application (“App”) and related services. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the App.

⸻

Service Description

TicketSaver is a personal tool that allows users to: • Store event tickets and related files locally on their device. • Forward confirmation emails and attachments (via Mailgun) to be processed and displayed in the App. • Manage events with limitations depending on subscription status (Free tier vs. Premium).

TicketSaver is not an event organizer, ticket issuer, or reseller. We only provide a digital storage and management tool.

⸻

Eligibility and Accounts

You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required by your jurisdiction) to use the App. If you create an Account, you agree to provide accurate information and to keep your credentials confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account.

⸻

License and Intellectual Property

Subject to these Terms, the Company grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download and use the App for your personal, non-commercial use. The App and all related content are owned by the Company or its licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, or create derivative works from the App except as permitted by law.

⸻

User Content

You retain ownership of tickets and other materials you import (“User Content”). You grant the Company a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to host, process, display, and transmit User Content solely as necessary to provide and improve the Service. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to upload and store User Content in the App and that such content does not violate applicable law or third-party rights.

⸻

No Guarantee of Ticket Validity • TicketSaver does not verify, validate, or guarantee that any ticket stored in the App will be accepted by an event organizer, venue, or third party. • Event organizers and venues remain solely responsible for ticket verification, admission, and enforcement of their own terms. • TicketSaver is not liable if a ticket is rejected, invalid, duplicated, expired, misused, or otherwise not honored.

⸻

No Liability for Loss of Tickets or Accounts • Tickets are primarily stored locally on your device. You are solely responsible for backing up your tickets (e.g., in the Files app or cloud storage). • If you delete the App, delete your account, or lose access to your device, your tickets may be permanently lost. • TicketSaver is not responsible for: • loss, corruption, or deletion of tickets, • failed or incomplete imports, • errors caused by device failure, app crashes, or user error.

⸻

Premium & Subscriptions • Premium features (e.g., unlimited events) require an active paid subscription. • Subscriptions are managed through the Apple App Store. TicketSaver has no control over billing, renewals, or refunds. Refund requests must be directed to Apple. • Free trials are offered once per user and may be restricted to prevent abuse. • When a subscription ends (including after a free trial): • You will retain access only to the first 5 events you created. • Other events remain stored but inaccessible until Premium is reactivated.

⸻

Subscription Management; Account Deletion

• Auto-Renewal and Cancellation. Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You must manage or cancel your Subscription in your Apple settings (App Store → Account → Subscriptions). We cannot cancel a Subscription for you.
• Account Deletion. Deleting your Account within the App does not cancel your Apple Subscription. If you want to stop being charged, you must cancel the Subscription in your Apple settings. We are not responsible for continued charges due to your failure to cancel with Apple.
• Access After Cancellation. You will retain Premium access until the end of the paid period; thereafter, your Account reverts to the Free tier limits.

⸻

Refunds and Chargebacks

All billing, renewals, and refunds are handled by Apple under the Apple Media Services Terms and App Store policies. The Company cannot issue refunds, credits, or adjustments. If you initiate a chargeback or payment dispute, we may suspend or terminate access pending resolution.

⸻

Anti-Abuse & Fraud Prevention

To protect the Service: • We validate purchases using server-side receipt validation. • We enforce device/session binding: only one active device may use your account at a time. • We may retain device identifiers or transaction records even after account deletion to detect and prevent: • repeated free-trial abuse, • account sharing, • fraudulent purchases.

⸻

Acceptable Use

You agree not to use the App to: • Violate applicable laws or third-party rights. • Import, store, or share tickets unlawfully (e.g., forged, duplicated, or resold tickets). • Circumvent or attempt to circumvent our fraud-prevention systems. • Upload malicious code, spam, or other harmful content.

Violation of these rules may result in suspension or termination of your account.

⸻

Third-Party Services

The App relies on third-party services, including but not limited to: • Firebase (authentication, database, crash reporting, analytics, cloud functions), • Mailgun (email forwarding and delivery), • Apple App Store (subscriptions, billing), • Social logins (Apple, Facebook).

TicketSaver is not responsible for the downtime, errors, or data handling practices of these third parties. Their use is governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

⸻

Changes to the Service: Availability

We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the App (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice, including for maintenance, security, legal, or business reasons. We are not liable for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation.

⸻

Beta Features

We may offer experimental or beta features. Such features are provided “AS IS,” may be discontinued at any time, and may contain errors.

⸻

Disclaimer of Warranties

The App is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. TicketSaver makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to: • That the App will function uninterrupted, error-free, or without security issues. • That tickets stored in the App will be valid, recognized, or accepted by third parties. • That data stored locally or in Firebase will never be lost, corrupted, or deleted.

⸻

Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law: • Exclusion of damages. TicketSaver shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, revenue, profits, goodwill, or event access, arising out of or in connection with the use of the App. • Free users. If you use the Service without a paid subscription, you agree that TicketSaver shall have no liability whatsoever for any claim, damage, or loss of any kind. • Premium users. If you have a paid subscription, TicketSaver’s total aggregate liability for direct damages shall not exceed the amount you actually paid for Premium during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim. • Scope. These limitations apply to all claims, whether based on contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, even if TicketSaver has been advised of the possibility of such damages. • Mandatory law carve-out. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law, such as liability for fraud, intentional misconduct, or gross negligence.

You acknowledge and agree that use of the App is entirely at your own risk, and that these limitations are an essential basis of the bargain between you and TicketSaver.

⸻

Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your (a) use of the App, (b) violation of these Terms, or (c) infringement of any third-party right.

⸻

Termination

We may suspend or terminate your account or access to the App if you: • Violate these Terms, • Misuse the App, • Engage in fraud, abuse, or unlawful conduct.

You may also terminate your account at any time by deleting it within the App.

⸻

Acceptance of Terms and Privacy Policy

Use of the App is only permitted if you have accepted both the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy. Your acceptance is stored locally on your Device. When you create or sign in to an Account, your existing acceptance is automatically synchronized and recorded in our systems for that Account. The synchronization updates the account record with the version of the Terms and Privacy Policy you accepted, the original acceptance date, and the most recent confirmation at login. By signing in with multiple accounts on the same Device, you confirm that each account is bound by your acceptance of the Terms and Privacy Policy.

⸻

Severability; Waiver

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force. Our failure to enforce any right or provision shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

⸻

Assignment

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms without restriction.

⸻

Governing Law & Jurisdiction • These Terms are governed by the laws of the Netherlands. • Any dispute shall be submitted exclusively to the competent courts of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

⸻

Notices

We may provide notices to you by in-app messages, email, or other reasonable means. You agree that electronic communications satisfy any legal requirement that communications be in writing.
