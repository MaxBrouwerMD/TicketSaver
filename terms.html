  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 26, 2025</p>

  <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the TicketSaver mobile application (“App”) and related services. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the App.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Service Description</h2>
  <p>TicketSaver is a personal tool that allows users to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Store event tickets and related files locally on their device.</li>
    <li>Forward confirmation emails and attachments (via Mailgun) to be processed and displayed in the App.</li>
    <li>Manage events with limitations depending on subscription status (Free tier vs. Premium).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>TicketSaver is not an event organizer, ticket issuer, or reseller. We only provide a digital storage and management tool.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required by your jurisdiction) to use the App. If you create an Account, you agree to provide accurate information and to keep your credentials confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>License and Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>Subject to these Terms, the Company grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download and use the App for your personal, non-commercial use.</p>
  <p>The App and all related content are owned by the Company or its licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, or create derivative works from the App except as permitted by law.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>User Content</h2>
  <p>You retain ownership of tickets and other materials you import (“User Content”). You grant the Company a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to host, process, display, and transmit User Content solely as necessary to provide and improve the Service. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to upload and store User Content in the App and that such content does not violate applicable law or third-party rights.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>No Guarantee of Ticket Validity</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>TicketSaver does not verify, validate, or guarantee that any ticket stored in the App will be accepted by an event organizer, venue, or third party.</li>
    <li>Event organizers and venues remain solely responsible for ticket verification, admission, and enforcement of their own terms.</li>
    <li>TicketSaver is not liable if a ticket is rejected, invalid, duplicated, expired, misused, or otherwise not honored.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>No Liability for Loss of Tickets or Accounts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tickets are primarily stored locally on your device. You are solely responsible for backing up your tickets (e.g., in the Files app or cloud storage).</li>
    <li>If you delete the App, delete your account, or lose access to your device, your tickets may be permanently lost.</li>
    <li>TicketSaver is not responsible for: loss, corruption, or deletion of tickets; failed or incomplete imports; errors caused by device failure, app crashes, or user error.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Premium &amp; Subscriptions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Premium features (e.g., unlimited events) require an active paid subscription.</li>
    <li>Subscriptions are managed through the Apple App Store. TicketSaver has no control over billing, renewals, or refunds. Refund requests must be directed to Apple.</li>
    <li>Free trials are offered once per user and may be restricted to prevent abuse.</li>
    <li>When a subscription ends (including after a free trial):
      <ul>
        <li>You will retain access only to the first 5 events you created.</li>
        <li>Other events remain stored but inaccessible until Premium is reactivated.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Subscription Management; Account Deletion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Auto-Renewal and Cancellation.</strong> Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You must manage or cancel your Subscription in your Apple settings (App Store → Account → Subscriptions). We cannot cancel a Subscription for you.</li>
    <li><strong>Account Deletion.</strong> Deleting your Account within the App does not cancel your Apple Subscription. If you want to stop being charged, you must cancel the Subscription in your Apple settings. We are not responsible for continued charges due to your failure to cancel with Apple.</li>
    <li><strong>Access After Cancellation.</strong> You will retain Premium access until the end of the paid period; thereafter, your Account reverts to the Free tier limits.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Refunds and Chargebacks</h2>
  <p>All billing, renewals, and refunds are handled by Apple under the Apple Media Services Terms and App Store policies. The Company cannot issue refunds, credits, or adjustments. If you initiate a chargeback or payment dispute, we may suspend or terminate access pending resolution.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Anti-Abuse &amp; Fraud Prevention</h2>
  <p>To protect the Service:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We validate purchases using server-side receipt validation.</li>
    <li>We enforce device/session binding: only one active device may use your account at a time.</li>
    <li>We may retain device identifiers or transaction records even after account deletion to detect and prevent:
      <ul>
        <li>repeated free-trial abuse,</li>
        <li>account sharing,</li>
        <li>fraudulent purchases.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to use the App to:</p>
  <ul>

    <li>Circumvent or attempt to circumvent our fraud-prevention systems.</li>
    <li>Upload malicious code, spam, or other harmful content.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
