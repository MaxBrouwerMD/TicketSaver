Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

While using Our Service, we may ask you to provide certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:
	•	Email address
	•	Authentication details (when using email/password, Apple, or Facebook login)
	•	Usage Data

	•	Diagnostic information and crash logs (via Firebase Crashlytics)
	•	Purchase receipts (for premium validation)

Information from Third-Party Login Services

If you log in via Apple or Facebook, we may receive your name, email address, and identifiers associated with those accounts.

Information from Device Access

You can enable or disable access via your Device settings at any time.

How We Use Your Personal Data

The Company may use Personal Data for the following purposes:
	•	To provide and maintain the Service – including account creation, authentication, and storage of your tickets.
	•	To enforce account restrictions – e.g., free accounts may store up to 5 events; premium accounts may store unlimited events.
	•	To validate purchases – using server-side receipt validation to detect fraud or abuse of free trials.
	•	To manage device sessions – including device/session binding to prevent account sharing. Device IDs may be retained even after account deletion to prevent repeated abuse.
	•	To send transactional emails – via Mailgun, for example, to forward ticket confirmation emails.
	•	To collect feedback – via Google Forms, if you voluntarily provide input.
	•	To monitor app stability and crashes – via Firebase Crashlytics.
	•	To comply with legal obligations – e.g., preventing fraud, abuse, or misuse of services.

**Consent Management**

- Before you can use the Service, you must explicitly accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.  
- Your consent is first stored locally on your Device. This ensures that you cannot use the App without giving consent.  
- If you later create or sign in to an Account, your local consent is synchronized to that Account in our Firestore database.  
- During this synchronization, we record:  
  • the version of the Terms and Privacy Policy you accepted,  
  • the **original date and time of your first acceptance** (as registered on your Device),  
  • the **date and time of your most recent confirmation** (synchronization at login),  
  • technical context, such as your device identifier and app version at acceptance.  
- Each time you log in with a new or different Account on the same Device, your prior acceptance is automatically applied to that Account and saved in Firestore.  
- This ensures that all accounts used on your Device are covered by the same legal consent you provided.  

⸻

Sharing Your Personal Data

We may share your personal data in the following cases:
	•	With Service Providers – such as Firebase (hosting, authentication, crash reporting), Mailgun (email forwarding), and Google Forms (feedback collection).
	•	For fraud prevention – e.g., device/session binding, receipt validation.
	•	For legal reasons – to comply with applicable law or protect rights, property, or safety.

We do not sell your data to third parties.

⸻

Data Retention
	•	Account and ticket data are retained while your account is active.
	•	If you delete your account, we will remove your personal data from our active systems.
	•	Certain identifiers (e.g., device ID) may be temporarily retained to enforce fraud-prevention rules, such as blocking trial abuse.
	•	Crash and diagnostic data may be stored by Firebase for up to 90 days.

⸻

Your Rights

You have the right to:
	•	Request access to the data we hold about you.
	•	Request deletion of your account and related personal data (except where retention is required by law or necessary to enforce fraud-prevention measures).
	•	Withdraw consent for optional data (such as camera or photo access).

Requests can be submitted to maxbrouwermd@gmail.com.

Security of Data

We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your information.
However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

The Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If you are aware that a child has provided Personal Data, please contact us.
