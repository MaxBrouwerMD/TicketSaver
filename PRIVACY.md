Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

Types of Data Collected

Personal Data

While using Our Service, we may ask you to provide certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:
•	Email address
•	Authentication details (when using email/password, Apple, or Facebook login)
•	Purchase receipts (for premium validation)
•	Consent metadata (e.g., version/date of accepted Terms & Privacy Policy, app version at acceptance, device identifier used for consent sync)

Usage Data

Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service. It may include:
•	IP address, Device identifiers, operating system, app version, language, and region
•	Diagnostic information and crash logs (via Firebase Crashlytics)
•	Interactions within the app (e.g., screens opened, certain actions) when analytics is enabled with your consent

Advertising IDs: TicketSaver does not use IDFA/AdTracking. We do not use Google Signals or Advertising Features.

Information from Third-Party Login Services

If you log in via Apple or Facebook, we may receive your name, email address, and identifiers associated with those accounts, as permitted by you.

Information from Device Access

With your permission, the Service may access:
•	Camera and photo library (to import tickets)
•	Files (to store tickets locally and export to the iOS Files app)

You can enable or disable access via your Device settings at any time.

⸻

SDKs and Providers We Use

Firebase Analytics (Google)

We use Firebase Analytics to understand how the app is used and to improve functionality. When enabled:
•	It collects event data (e.g., successful login/sign-up, ticket categorized, premium purchase), app instance identifiers, device/OS info, and approximate location (country/region) derived from IP for aggregated reporting (e.g., the “map” you may see in dashboards).
•	We disable analytics until you give consent. You can withdraw consent at any time in the app settings, where available (or by contacting us).
•	We do not enable Google Advertising Features or Google Signals in TicketSaver.

Retention: Firebase Analytics retains user and event data according to Google’s standard retention settings (typically 2 months by default and configurable up to 14 months, subject to Google’s policies).

Firebase Crashlytics

We use Firebase Crashlytics to monitor app stability and fix crashes. Crash reports may include:
•	Device model, OS version, app version, timestamp, non-sensitive logs around the crash
•	No advertising identifiers, and no content of your tickets

Retention: Crash data is typically retained by Google for around 90 days (subject to Google’s policies).

Mailgun (Email processing)

If you forward confirmation emails/attachments, Mailgun processes and delivers these emails for ingestion by TicketSaver. Attachments may be temporarily processed to extract relevant ticket data.

Apple App Store (In-App Purchases)

Apple processes Subscription billing, renewals, refunds, and related financial information through your Apple ID. We may receive non-financial purchase metadata (e.g., transaction identifiers or signed receipts) to validate entitlements; we do not receive your full payment details from Apple.

For all providers above, processing takes place under the providers’ terms and data processing agreements. International transfers may occur and are protected by appropriate safeguards (see International Transfers).

⸻

How We Use Your Personal Data

The Company may use Personal Data for the following purposes:
•	To provide and maintain the Service – including account creation, authentication, and storage of your tickets.
•	To enforce account restrictions – e.g., free accounts may store up to 5 events; premium accounts may store unlimited events.
•	To validate purchases – using server-side receipt validation to detect fraud or abuse of free trials.
•	To manage device sessions – including device/session binding to prevent account sharing. Device IDs may be retained even after account deletion to prevent repeated abuse.
•	To send transactional emails – via Mailgun, for example, to forward ticket confirmation emails.
•	To provide push notifications and reminders – only if you enable notifications on your Device.
•	To collect feedback – via Google Forms, if you voluntarily provide input.
•	To monitor app stability and crashes – via Firebase Crashlytics.
•	To analyze usage – via Firebase Analytics, only with your consent to improve the app and user experience.
•	To secure the Service – including detection, prevention, and response to security incidents and abuse.
•	To comply with legal obligations – e.g., preventing fraud, abuse, or misuse of services, and responding to lawful requests.

⸻

Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR/AVG)

Where applicable law (e.g., EU/EEA, UK) requires a legal basis:
•	Contract/Performance: Providing the core Service you request (account, ticket storage).
•	Consent: Analytics and optional features that are not strictly necessary (we collect analytics only after you consent).
•	Legitimate Interests: Security, anti-fraud (e.g., device/session binding, receipt validation), and app stability (Crashlytics) in a way that respects your rights.
•	Legal Obligation: Where we must comply with the law.

You may withdraw consent at any time (see Your Choices & Controls).

⸻

Your Choices & Controls
•	Analytics Consent: In-app analytics is off by default until you accept. You may later disable analytics in the app settings (where provided) or by contacting us; we will then stop sending future analytics events from that device/account.
•	Device Permissions: You can manage camera/photos/files access in iOS Settings.
•	Notifications: You can enable/disable push notifications in iOS Settings at any time. Disabling will stop future notifications.
•	Email Preferences: Transactional emails are necessary for the Service; we do not send marketing emails.
•	Access/Deletion Requests: See Your Rights below.

⸻

Consent Management

Before you can use the Service, you must explicitly accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
Your consent is stored locally on your Device and synchronized to your Account upon login. During synchronization, we record:
•	the version of the Terms/Privacy you accepted,
•	the original date/time of first acceptance (from your Device),
•	the most recent confirmation date/time (at login),
•	app version and a device identifier used for consent sync.

Using multiple Accounts on the same Device applies the same consent to each Account.

⸻

Sharing Your Personal Data

We may share your personal data in the following cases:
•	With Service Providers – such as Firebase (authentication, database, crash reporting, analytics, cloud functions), Mailgun (email forwarding), and Google Forms (feedback collection).
•	For fraud prevention and security – e.g., device/session binding, receipt validation.
•	For legal reasons – to comply with applicable law or protect rights, property, or safety.
•	Business transfers – in connection with any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business, subject to appropriate safeguards.

We do not sell your data to third parties.

⸻

International Transfers

Our Service Providers may process data in the EU/EEA, the United States, and other jurisdictions. Where required, transfers are protected by recognized safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses and provider-implemented measures). You can contact us for more details.

⸻

Data Retention
•	Account and ticket data are retained while your account is active.
•	If you delete your account, we will remove your personal data from our active systems.
•	Certain identifiers (e.g., device ID) may be temporarily retained to enforce fraud-prevention rules (e.g., repeat trial abuse).
•	Crash data (Crashlytics) is typically retained for about 90 days.
•	Analytics data retention follows Firebase Analytics’ settings/policies (commonly 2–14 months).
•	We may retain limited data where required by law or to resolve disputes.
•	Backups and logs: routine system backups and server logs may persist for limited periods and are purged on rolling schedules.

⸻

Your Rights

Subject to applicable law, you have the right to:
•	Request access to the data we hold about you.
•	Request correction or deletion of your data (except where retention is required by law or necessary to enforce anti-abuse measures).
•	Withdraw consent for optional processing (e.g., analytics).
•	Object to or request restriction of certain processing.
•	Data portability, where applicable.
•	Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. In the Netherlands, this is the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens.

Requests can be submitted to maxbrouwermd@gmail.com. We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding.

⸻

Automated Decision-Making

We do not engage in profiling that produces legal or similarly significant effects, nor do we make decisions based solely on automated processing that significantly affect you.

⸻

Security of Data

We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your information (including encryption in transit and the security controls of our cloud providers). However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

⸻

Children’s Privacy

The Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If you are aware that a child has provided Personal Data, please contact us.

⸻

External Services and Links

Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or use integrations with external services (e.g., Apple, Facebook, Google). We are not responsible for their privacy practices.

⸻

Account Deletion and Apple Subscriptions

Deleting your Account within the App removes your personal data from our active systems, subject to the retention rules set out above. Deleting your Account does not cancel your Apple Subscription. Subscriptions are managed through your Apple ID, and only you can cancel or modify them in your Apple settings (App Store → Account → Subscriptions). We cannot cancel a Subscription on your behalf.

⸻

Important Disclaimers
•	TicketSaver stores tickets locally on your Device and optionally in Firebase for backup purposes.
•	The Company is not responsible for lost, deleted, or corrupted tickets, including cases of device loss or app removal.
•	The Company is not responsible if event organizers refuse to accept or recognize tickets stored in the Application.
•	Users remain fully responsible for verifying ticket validity with event organizers.
•	Premium access is subscription-based; if canceled, you will lose access to tickets beyond the free account limit, though they remain stored.

⸻

Data Breach Notification

If we become aware of a personal data breach likely to result in a risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify you and the relevant supervisory authority as required by law.

⸻

Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted here with the “Last updated” date.
